Southern Outpost was formed in October 1998 by 3 DJ's from Sydney's underground electro/techno scene. 

The Southern Outpost name came about when visiting the old Submerge building at 2030 Grand River Ave, Detroit. AS is typical for all visitors to Submerge, the wall was signed with a personal message to the Submerge crew. It was signed "much respect from the southern outpost". On seeing this, Mad Mike Banks said, "That would be a great name for your record label"
