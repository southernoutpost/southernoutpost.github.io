Southern Outpost was formed in October 1998 by Patrick Wacher, Philip Chan & Daniel Horth, 3 DJ's active in Sydney's underground electro/techno scene. 

The name Southern Outpost came about accidently... whilst Patrick was visiting the old Submerge building at [2030 Grand River Ave](https://flic.kr/p/nAsPCU), he signed the wall (as all visitors were asked to do) with a personal message to the Submerge crew. It was signed "much respect from the southern outpost". On seeing this, Mad Mike Banks said, "That would be a great name for your record label".... that's where it started. After returning from Detroit and meeting his major musical influences, Patrick was inspired to produce and release music with talented local musicians Sofie Loizou (shapeShiftr, Miss Memory) and Ryan O'Loughlin (Data). SO-001 Setting The Agenda was born.

Initially, the main focus of the label was to solely release local electro music from the core members of Southern Outpost, but the urge to work with producers from other parts of the world that influenced us was too great. Southern Outpost is proud to have worked with artists such as DJ K1, DJ Godfather, Strand, Shadow People, dynArec, Scape One & Dcast Dynamics.

Southern Outpost wouldn't be what it is today without the time and dedication that has been put in by many talented individuals. From the artists, designers, DJ's, distributors, record stores, our close friends and families.

It hasn't been an easy ride, we started with a 12" ep and no knowledge on how to run a label (still learning!), but we are dedicated to standing strong and releasing music that we feel passionate about. Hopefully you can appreciate the music as much as we do. Thanks for your support!
